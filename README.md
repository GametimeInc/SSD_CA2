# Pets, Lost & Found
This is a college PHP project that uses HTML/CSS/JS/PHP on the front-end, using a DKIT server and a MySQL database.

Users of this website will be able to view pets that have been lost and found, with information on that pet, the person who lost/found it, and how long it has been since the post was made.

The contact form, when submitted in the correct format (*checked with user-friendly client-side validation, and also server side validation*), sends an email to the email address speciifed in the database.php file.
